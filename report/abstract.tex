Textual sentiment analysis can provide clues for devising a successful financial market trading strategy. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a branch of sentiment analysis which deals with both identifying aspects and the sentiment expressed towards them.
However, existing research applying ABSA to the financial domain is limited.
Labeled datasets are scarce.
Financial incentives encourage successful research in the financial domain to stay private.
Of the published approaches, many use outdated methodologies, such as bag-of-words.
Using a BERT architecture, we devise a method of identifying aspects in financial news headlines and predicting the expressed sentiment.
We evaluate our approach on sub-task 1 of the FiQA 2018 challenge.
We show that large pre-trained language models, coupled with domain specific fine-tuning and semi-supervised data augmentation produce competitive results in state-of-the-art Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) tasks.
